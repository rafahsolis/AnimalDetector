# Animal Detection Dataset Configuration
# This file tells YOLO where to find your training data and what classes to detect

# Path to dataset root directory
# Use absolute path for reliability, or relative path from this file
path: /home/rafa/PycharmProjects/AnimalDetector/datasets/animal_dataset

# Paths to image directories (relative to 'path' above)
train: train/images
val: val/images
test: test/images

# Number of classes (must match the number of animal types)
nc: 4

# Class names in order (index matches class_id in label files)
# Class 0 = rabbit, Class 1 = fox, Class 2 = wild_boar, Class 3 = bird
names:
  0: rabbit
  1: fox
  2: wild_boar
  3: bird

# Optional: Additional training parameters
# Uncomment and modify as needed

# Data augmentation settings (YOLO applies these automatically)
# hsv_h: 0.015  # HSV-Hue augmentation (fraction)
# hsv_s: 0.7    # HSV-Saturation augmentation (fraction)
# hsv_v: 0.4    # HSV-Value augmentation (fraction)
# degrees: 0.0  # Image rotation (+/- deg)
# translate: 0.1  # Image translation (+/- fraction)
# scale: 0.5    # Image scale (+/- gain)
# shear: 0.0    # Image shear (+/- deg)
# perspective: 0.0  # Image perspective (+/- fraction), range 0-0.001
# flipud: 0.0   # Image flip up-down (probability)
# fliplr: 0.5   # Image flip left-right (probability)
# mosaic: 1.0   # Image mosaic (probability)
# mixup: 0.0    # Image mixup (probability)
